# AlRecall  

>Just a little library containing classic algorithms implementations. 
>Implemented just for fun and refreshing CS fundamentals.

Sorting algorithms:
* Heap Sort.  Worst time complexity: n^2, Avg. time complexity nlogn.
* Quick Sort. Worst and Avg time complexity: nlogn.
* Merge Sort. Worst and Avg time complexity: nlogn.
* Insertion Sort. Worst and Avg time complexity: n^2.

is not usually used for large arrays, but its avg time complexity is pretty quick for short
arrays(around 10 elements). It's also an online algorithm so can be also used 
to sort streams.
