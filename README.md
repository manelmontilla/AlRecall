>Just a little library containing classic sort algorithms implementation 
>in dotnet core.


Library  implements three classic sorting algorithms:
* Heap Sort.  Worst time complexity: n^2, Avg. time complexity nlogn.
* Quick Sort. Worst and Avg time complexity: nlogn.
* Merge Sort. Worst and Avg time complexity: nlogn.

It also implements the Insertion Sort Algorithm that

is not usually used for large arrays, but its avg time complexity is pretty quick for short
arrays(around 10 elements). It's also an online algorithm so can be also used 
to sort streams.

# Run instructions and examples

>Examples of use in tests directory.
>>>>>>> adc5b5e... minor fixes in license a readme

>To run the tests just go to "tests/tests.Alrecall/" and execute 
dotnet test. 
>If you don't have installed dotnet core, follow the instructions [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) to install .
